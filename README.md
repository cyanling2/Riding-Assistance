# Riding-Assistance
We designed and built a system that could automatically detect the STOP signs ahead the bicycle and
alert the rider to stop the bicycle. If no action is taken by the rider, our system will smoothly and safely
auto-trigger the bicycleâ€™s brake system and force it to halt. We hope our project could help bicycle riders
to be more aware of the importance of STOP signs in the street and protect the safety of themselves
and other vehicle drivers. In this paper, the detailed design ideas, block diagrams, function of each
modules, future modifications and the general cost of the device will be presented
