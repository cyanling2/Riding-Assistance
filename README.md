# Riding-Assistance

We designed and built a system that could automatically detect the STOP signs ahead the bicycle and
alert the rider to stop the bicycle. If no action is taken by the rider, our system will smoothly and safely
auto-trigger the bicycleâ€™s brake system and force it to halt. We hope our project could help bicycle riders
to be more aware of the importance of STOP signs in the street and protect the safety of themselves
and other vehicle drivers. In this paper, the detailed design ideas, block diagrams, function of each
modules, future modifications and the general cost of the device will be presented

The purpose of our project is to improve the safety of bicyclists and, at the same time, reduce the STOP
sign violation rate in the traffic laws. Currently, the traffic laws for bicycles are relatively not
comprehensive enough, which leaves potentially unsafety for bicyclists. In 2018, 857 people in the
United States died in bicycle accidents. That number was the highest since 1990 [1]. In 2016, about 71%
of deaths due to bicycle accidents occurred in urban areas and 30% occurred at intersections [2]. It was
recommended that all bicyclists should wear a helmet but no state has so far announced such a law to
rule that, which caused the tragedies.

Furthermore, as one of the important methods of transportation in the world, the bicycle has never
acquired equal attention to its development as other vehicles, like the car and the motorcycle. While
autonomous driving has become a mainstream in the development of vehicles, many cars have installed
intelligent driving assistance like lane-keeping, blind-spot detector, auto-parking. Motorcycles also have
riding assistance products. All these products help avoid traffic accidents and therefore protect drivers
and riders. However, similar kinds of products are barely seen on bicycles.

Our solution was to create a riding assist for bicycles and thus lower the risk of a bicycle accident at
crossing roads. In this project, we plan to build an autobrake system that will force the bicycle to stop at
STOP signs. The STOP sign is such an important traffic signal that anyone who learns to drive will be
taught about rules relevant to it. However, bicyclists in most countries do not need a license to ride
legally and thus may lack such kind of safety awareness. Therefore, this project will help solving this
problem in two directions in general: first, reminding the bicyclists about the STOP sign; second, forcing
the brake if no action is taken, which means the bicyclists does not take any action to slow down. Finally,
the product should be easy to install and have an affordable price.
